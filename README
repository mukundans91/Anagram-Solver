This is a simple application where I use in built sqlite module in python to store a set of words and then given a word as input try to get all the other anagrams of that word.

The various folders try* signify certain changes I made to the main code.

The file merge.py is used to merge all the *.txt files to produce one file containing the list of all the words.
